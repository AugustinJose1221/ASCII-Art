# ASCII-Art<br>

<p>This program converts an input RGB image and prints a grayscale image made using ASCII characters.The size of the output image depends on the size and resolution of the input image.To view the output image properly, alter the font size of the text.In most cases, a small font size produce better results.<p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>The program converts the image into a grayscale image.It is then divided into small cell.The intensity of the cell is then calculated and an ASCII character which produce a similar intensity is printed in its place.This process is continued throughout the image and the complete text is saved to the output text file.<p>
 
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Enter the location on the image file as the value of the variable <i>inputImageFileName</i>.You can either provide a location of an existing text file to the variable <i>OutputTextFileName</i> or let the compiler create a new text file named <i>Output.txt</i>.Then run the program</p>
